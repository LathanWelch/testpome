<hr>
<p>All day long when the shells sail over<br/>
I stand at the sandbags and take my chance;<br>
But at night, at night I'm a reckless rover,<br>
And over the parapet Gleams Romance.<br>
Romance! Romance! How i've dreamed it, writing<br>
Dreary old records of money and mart,<br>
Me with my head chuckful of fighting<br>
and the blood of viking to thrill my heart.</p>
<p>But little I though that my time was coming,<br/>
sudden and splendid, sipreme and soon;<br/>
And here I am with the bullets humming<br/>
As O craw; amd O cirse the ;ight of the moon.<br/>
Out alone, for adventure thrsting,<br/>
Out in mysterious No Man's Land;<br/>
Prone with the dead when a star-shell, bursting<br/>
Flares on the horros on every hand.<br/>
There are ruby stars and they drip and wiggle;<br/>
And the grasses gleam in a light blood-red;<br/>
There are emerald stars, and their tails they wriggle,<br/>
And ghastly they glare on the face of the dead.<br/>
But the worst of all are the stars of whiteness,<br/>
That spill in a pool of perarly flame<br/>
Pretty as gems in their silver brightness,<br/>
<p>And etching a man for a bullet's aim.<br/>
Yet oh, it's great to be here with danger,<br/>
Here in the weird, death-pregnant dark,<br/>
In the devil's pasture a stealthy ranger,<br/>
When the moon is decently hiding. Hark!<br/>
What was that? Was it just the shiver<br/>
Of an eeri wind or a clammy hand?<br/>
The rustle of grass, or the passing quiver<br/>
Of one of the ghosts of no man's Land?</p>
<p>It's only at night when the ghosts awaken,<br/>
And gibber and whisper horrible things;<br/>
For to every foot of this God-forsaken<br/>
Zone of jeopard some horror clings.<br/>
Ugh! What was that? It felt like a jelly,<br/>
That flattish mound in the nosisome grass;<br/>
You tgree bug rats running free of its belly,<br/>
That flattish mound in the noisome grass;<br/>
You three big rats running freee of its belly,<br/>
Out of my way and let me pass!</p>
<p>But if there's horror, there's beauty,wonder;<br/>
The trench light gleam and the rockets play.<br/>
That flood of magnificent orange youder<br/>
is a battery blazing miles away.<br/>
With a rush and a singing a great shell passes;<br/>
The rifles resentfully bicker and brawl,<br/>
and here I crouch in the dew-drebcged grasses,<br/>
And look abd listen and love it all.</p>
<p>God! What a life! But I must make haste now,<br/>
Before the shadow of night be spent.<br/>
it's little the time there is to waste now,<br/>
If I'd do the job for which I was sent.<br/>
My boombs are right and my clippers ready,<br/>
And I wriggle out to the vhosen place,<br/>
When I hear a rustle ...Steady!...Steady!<br/>
Who am I staring slap in the face?</p>
<p>There in the dark I can hear him breathing,<br/>
A foot away, and as still as death;<br/>
And my heart beast hard, abd my brain is seething,<br/>
And I know he's a Hun by the smell of his breath.<br/>
Then:"Will you surrender?" I whisper hoarsely,<br/>
For it's death, swift death to utter a cry.<br/>
"English schwein-hund!" he murmurs coaseky.<br/>
"Then we'll fight it out in the dark," say I.</p>
<p>So we grip and we slip and we trip and wrestle<br/>
There in the gutter of No Man's Land;<br/>
And I feel my nails in his wind-pipe nestle,<br/>
And he tries to gouge, but i bite his hand.<br/>
And he tries to squeal, but I squeeze him tighter:<br/>
"Now" I say, "I can Kill you fine;<br/>
But tell me first, you Teutonic blighter!<br/>
Have you any children?" He answers:"Nein."</p>
<p>NINE! Well, I cannot kill such a father,<br/>
So I tie his hands and I leave him there.<br/>
Do I finish my little job?Well, rather;<<br/>
And I get home safe with some light to spare.<br/>
Heigh-ho! by day it's just prosy duty,<br/>
Doing the same old song and dance;<br/>
But oh! with the night- joy,Glory,Beauty:<br/>
Over the parapet- Life, Romance!</p>
